# Power Apps

Little snippets, functions, and code that I want to remember later.

## Format currency

EN-US $2,000.00

```
Text( currencyfield, "[$-en-US]$ #,###.00" )
```
## Create a Collection by hand

When I have an app where I want to reference specific fields, but I haven't attached to a data source, I like to use a Collection as a placeholder. This allows me to use similar data to get things looking right. 

The following example is from an app where I later populated a URL list based on a search query. Simple 2-column blank table:

```
ClearCollect(flowSiteURL,{url:"",name:""});
```

The format with sample data and additional rows can look like this:

```
ClearCollect(flowSiteURL,{url:"https://make.powerapps.com",name:"Power Platform Maker Portal"},{url:"https://connectingthedata.com",name:"Connecting the Data website"});
```
